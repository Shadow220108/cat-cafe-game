Cat Cafe Manager

Welcome to my game! Cat Cafe Manager is a cozy, top-down pixel art game where you take care of a room full of chaotic (and hungry) cats. Built with Godot 4.

I wanted to build a game where cats actually act like cats—they wander around, get hungry, and if you ignore them for too long, they go on a nap and refuse to move. Your job is to make sure they are fed, rested, and happy.
